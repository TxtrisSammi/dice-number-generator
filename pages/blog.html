        <p>It was a dark and stormy night, I was lost in the woods looking, searching for the final piece
            that would make this website complete. The only thing missing in this otherwise flawless website...
            That item, that artifact was none other than the <strong>dice</strong> of <em>true randomness</em>. The only
            item capable of generating truly <em>random</em> numbers. Without those <strong>dice</strong> this website
            will never be complete.

    <!-- Maybe a little unnecessary on the heading, but I enjoy the dramatic effect -->

                <h4>Or is it?
                    <h5>Yes it is....
                        <h6>It might not be tho....</h6>
                    </h5>

        <p>After weeks of arduous research I have stumbled into a cave, I'm not sure if I'm heading in the right direction,
            but there's something calling me, beckoning me towards the cave. If I don't make it back <strong><em>dont
                    follow me!!!</em></strong>
            the risk is far too great to justify the reward... <em>however,</em> I <strong>must</strong> do this...
